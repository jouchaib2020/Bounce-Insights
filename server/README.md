# Server implementation of Thesis Managment
To start the server make sure you have Docker Desktop installed. You can find the link and instructions to install it [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). After installing it make sure you have WSL running on Windows, then navigate to <code>/src/services</code> and execute the following commands
```
npm run docker:init
npm run db:push
npm run db:generate
```

After executing a message should appear indicating that the database is in sync with the Prisma schema. Then navigate back to  <code>/src</code> and start the server by executing
```
nodemon server.js
```
or if you do not have nodemon installed
```
node server.js
```



## Useful commands
If you want to explore the database by using a web interface (very useful for creating database mock data) you can use the command
```
npm run db:studio
```
Other useful commands are listed here (courtesy of Ibra):
| Command         | Explaination     |
|--------------|-----------|
| **db:migrate** | adds the current version of the database to version control (git but for prisma)      | 
| **db:generate**    |  Updates the prisma client with the contents of schema.prisma (run it every time you make changes)    |
